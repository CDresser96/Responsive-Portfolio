      <p>Hi, my name is Cecilia Dresser and I’m currently a student at Kansas University in their Coding Bootcamp program. Upon receiving my certificate I will be diverse in Front-end and Back-end development in multiple coding languages. I have a passion for innovation and standing out. I strive to create high quality content by constantly learning to improve upon my skills.</p>

      <p>I am from Kansas City, Missouri but would be willing to work remotely. I’m interested in small up-and-coming businesses to large international companies; and everything else in between! The ideal position for me would be in a company that allows me to progress as a Full-Stack Developer and is able to help me grow in my field. Feel free to check out my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio Page</a> to look at some of my recent work. Please don’t hesitate to use my <a href="contact.html">Contact Page</a> to reach me with any inquiries or requests.</p>
